<p>"Rhythmische Gymnastik" is the name by which the Dalcroze method is
known in Germany, but whether or not the German words are adequate,
their literal translation into English certainly gives too narrow an
idea of the scope of the system to any one unacquainted with it.
Rhythmical "gymnastics," in the natural meaning of the word, is a part
of the Dalcroze training, and a not unimportant part, but it is only one
application of a much wider principle; and accordingly, where the term
occurs in the following pages, it must be understood simply as denoting
a particular mode of physical drill. But for the principle itself and
the total method embodying it, another name is needed, and the term
"Eurhythmics" has been here coined for the purpose. The originality of
the Dalcroze method, the fact that it is a discovery, gives it a right
to a name of its own: it is because it is in a sense also the
rediscovery of an old secret that a name has been chosen of such plain
reference and derivation. Plato, in the words quoted above, has said
that the whole of a man's life stands in need of a right rhythm: and it
is natural to see some kinship between this Platonic attitude and the
claim of Dalcroze that his discovery is not a mere refinement of
dancing, nor an improved method of music-teaching, but a principle that
must have effect upon every part of life.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EDUCATIONAL_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_HELLERAU"
id="THE_EDUCATIONAL_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_HELLERAU"></a>THE EDUCATIONAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF HELLERAU</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 11]</span>At Hellerau two things make an
ineffaceable impression upon the mind&mdash;the exquisite beauty of
movement, of gesture and of grouping seen in the exercises; and the
nearness of a great force, fundamental to the arts and expressing itself
in the rhythm to which they attain. Jaques-Dalcroze has re-opened a door
which has long been closed. He has rediscovered one of the secrets of
Greek education.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago Wilhelm von Humboldt endeavoured to make Greek
ideals the paramount influence in the higher schools of Germany. He and
a group of friends had long felt indignant at the utilitarianism and
shallowness of the work of the schools. In Greek literature, Greek
philosophy and Greek art would be found a means of kindling new life in
education and of giving it the power of building up strong and
independent personalities. When there came to Humboldt the unexpected
opportunity of reforming the secondary schools of Prussia, he so
remodelled the course of study as to secure for Greek thought and
letters a place which, if not central and determinative, would at least
bring the &eacute;lite of the younger generation in some measure under
their influence. But his administrative orders failed to impart to the
schools the spirit of ancient Greece. To Humboldt and his friends Greek
studies had been an <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 12]</span>inspiration
because, apart from their intellectual significance and literary form,
those studies had been the channel of an artistic impulse and had been
entered into as art. But this artistic power was not felt by the greater
number of those who undertook, in obedience to the new regulations, the
duty of teaching Greek in the schools. What was left in Greek studies
after this failure of artistic insight was often no more than another
form of purely intellectual discipline. A new subject had been added to
the curriculum, but new life had not been brought into the schools. The
very name, Gymnasium, which denoted their Hellenic purpose, seemed
ironical. They were not Greek in spirit and they ignored the training of
the body. Thus what Wilhelm von Humboldt had chiefly aimed at
accomplishing, he failed to do. It was not the power of Greek art that
he brought into the schools but, in most cases, merely the philological
study of a second dead language. The cause of his failure was that he
had not discovered the educational method which could effectually secure
his purpose. He had assumed that, in order to introduce the Greek spirit
into education, it was sufficient to insist upon the linguistic and
literary study of Greek.</p>

<p>In time, attempts were made to remedy what was defective in
Humboldt's plan by insisting upon physical exercises as an obligatory
part of education in the higher schools. But the physical exercises thus
introduced, though salutary in themselves, were divorced from the
artistic influences of the Greek gymnastic. Humboldt's chief aim had
been forgotten. His system of organization had rooted itself, but his
educational ideal, to which <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 13]</span>he
attached far greater importance than to administrative regulation, was
ignored.</p>

<p>In later years, though such Neo-Hellenism as Humboldt's had long gone
out of fashion, the weakness of the higher schools on the side of
artistic training was recognized. But a corrective for this was sought
in instruction about art, not (except so far as a little teaching of
drawing went) in the practice of an art. An attempt was made to
cultivate aesthetic appreciation by lessons which imparted knowledge but
did not attempt to train the power of artistic production&mdash;an aim which
was regarded as unrealizable, except in vocal music, and of course
through literary composition, in a secondary school. Thus Humboldt's
original purpose has been almost wholly unachieved. The schools,
admirably organized on the intellectual side and, within certain limits,
increasingly efficient in their physical training, are, as a rule,
lacking in the influence of art, as indeed in most cases are the
corresponding schools in other countries. The spring of artistic
training has not been touched. The divorce between intellectual
discipline and artistic influence (except indeed so far as the latter is
operative through the study of literature, through a little drawing, and
through vocal music) is complete. This defect is felt even more keenly
in Germany than in England, because in the German schools the
intellectual pressure is more severe, and the schools do less for the
cultivation of those interests which lie outside the limits of regular
class-room work.</p>

<p>Wilhelm von Humboldt gave little direct attention to the work of the
elementary schools. His chief concern <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
14]</span>was with higher education. But in the elementary schools also,
except in so far as they gave much care to vocal music, the course of
training failed to make use of the educative power of art. A conviction
that there is an error has led in Germany, as in England and America, to
an increased attention to drawing and to attempts to interest children
in good pictures. But there is still (except in the case of vocal music
and a little drawing) an unbridged gap between the intellectual and the
artistic work of the schools.</p>

<p>Jaques-Dalcroze's experience suggests the possibility of a much closer
combination of these two elements, both in elementary and in secondary
education. His teaching requires from the pupils a sustained and careful
attention, is in short a severe (though not exhausting) intellectual
exercise; while at the same time it trains the sense of form and rhythm,
the capacity to analyse musical structure, and the power of expressing
rhythm through harmonious movement. It is thus a synthesis of
educational influence, artistic and intellectual. Its educational value
for young children, its applicability to their needs, the pleasure which
they take in the exercises, have been conclusively proved. And in the
possibility of this widely extended use of the method lies perhaps the
chief, though far indeed from the only, educational significance of what
is now being done at Hellerau.</p>

EDUCATION</h2>

<h3>FROM THE FRENCH OF E. JAQUES-DALCROZE<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1"
id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> First published
in <i>Le Rhythme</i> (B&acirc;le) of December,
1909.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is barely a hundred years since music ceased to be an aristocratic
art cultivated by a few privileged individuals and became instead a
subject of instruction for almost everybody without regard to talent or
exceptional ability. Schools of Music, formerly frequented only by born
musicians, gifted from birth with unusual powers of perception for sound
and rhythm, to-day receive all who are fond of music, however little
Nature may have endowed them with the necessary capacity for musical
expression and realization. The number of solo players, both pianists
and violinists, is constantly increasing, instrumental technique is
being developed to an extraordinary degree, but everywhere, too, the
question is being asked whether the quality of instrumental players is
equal to their quantity, and whether the acquirement of extraordinary
technique is likely to help musical progress when this technique is not
joined to musical powers, if not of the first rank, at least normal.</p>

<p>Of ten certificated pianists of to-day, at the most one, if indeed one,
is capable of recognizing one key from another, of improvising four bars
with character or so as to give pleasure to the listener, of giving
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 16]</span>expression to a composition without
the help of the more or less numerous annotations with which present day
composers have to burden their work, of experiencing any feeling
whatever when they listen to, or perform, the composition of another.
The solo players of older days were without exception complete
musicians, able to improvise and compose, artists driven irresistibly
towards art by a noble thirst for aesthetic expression, whereas most
young people who devote themselves nowadays to solo playing have the
gifts neither of hearing nor of expression, are content to imitate the
composer's expression without the power of feeling it, and have no other
sensibility than that of the fingers, no other motor faculty than an
automatism painfully acquired. Solo playing of the present day has
specialized in a finger technique which takes no account of the faculty
of mental expression. It is no longer a means, it has become an end.</p>

<p>As a rule, writing is only taught to children who have reached a
thinking age, and we do not think of initiating them into the art of
elocution until they have got something to say, until their powers of
comprehension, analysis and feeling begin to show themselves. All modern
educationalists are agreed that the first step in a child's education
should be to teach him to know himself, to accustom him to life and to
awaken in him sensations, feelings and emotions, before giving him the
power of describing them. Likewise, in modern methods of teaching to
draw, the pupil is taught to see objects before painting them. In music,
unfortunately, the same rule does not hold. Young people are taught to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 17]</span>play the compositions of Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt, before their minds and ears can
grasp these works, before they have developed the faculty of being moved
by them.</p>

<p>There are two physical agents by means of which we appreciate music.
These two agents are the ear as regards sound, and the whole nervous
system as regards rhythm. Experience has shown me that the training of
these two agents cannot easily be carried out simultaneously. A child
finds it difficult to appreciate at the same time a succession of notes
forming a melody and the rhythm which animates them.</p>

<p>Before teaching the relation which exists between sound and movement, it
is wise to undertake the independent study of each of these two
elements. Tone is evidently secondary, since it has not its origin and
model in ourselves, whereas movement is instinctive in man and therefore
primary. Therefore I begin the study of music by careful and
experimental teaching of movement. This is based in earliest childhood
on the automatic exercise of marching, for marching is the natural model
of time measure.</p>

<p>By means of various accentuations with the foot, I teach the different
time measures. Pauses (of varying lengths) in the marching teach the
children to distinguish durations of sound; movements to time with the
arms and the head preserve order in the succession of the time measures
and analyse the bars and pauses.</p>

<p>All this, no doubt, seems very simple, and so I thought when
beginning my experiments. Unfortunately, the latter have shown me that
it is not so simple as it seems, <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
18]</span>but on the contrary very complicated. And this because most
children have no instinct for time, for time values, for accentuation,
for physical balance; because the motor faculties are not the same in
all individuals, and because a number of obstacles impede the exact and
rapid physical realization of mental conceptions. One child is always
behind the beat when marching, another always ahead; another takes
unequal steps, another on the contrary lacks balance. All these faults,
if not corrected in the first years, will reappear later in the musical
technique of the individual.</p>

<p>Unsteady time when singing or playing, confusion in playing, inability
to follow when accompanying, accentuating too roughly or with lack of
precision, all these faults have their origin in the child's muscular
and nervous control, in lack of co-ordination between the mind which
conceives, the brain which orders, the nerve which transmits and the
muscle which executes. And still more, the power of phrasing and shading
music with feeling depends equally upon the training of the
nerve-centres, upon the co-ordination of the muscular system, upon rapid
communication between brain and limbs&mdash;in a word, upon the health of the
whole organism; and it is by trying to discover the individual cause of
each musical defect, and to find a means of correcting it, that I have
gradually built up my method of eurhythmics.</p>

<p>This method is entirely based upon experiments many times repeated,
and not one of the exercises has been adopted until it has been applied
under different forms and under different conditions and its usefulness
definitely proved. Many people have a
completely <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 19]</span>false idea of my system,
and consider it is a simple variant on the methods of physical training
at present in fashion, whose inventors have undoubtedly rendered great
service to humanity.</p>

<p>I cannot help smiling when I read in certain papers, over names which
carry weight, articles in which my method is compared to other gymnastic
systems. The fact is, my book is simply a register of the different
exercises which I have invented, and says nothing of my ideas in
general, for it is written for those who have learnt to interpret my
meaning under my personal tuition at Geneva and Hellerau.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, half the critics who have done me the honour of
discussing the book, have only glanced through it and looked at the
photographs. Not one of them has undergone the special training upon
which I lay stress and without which I deny absolutely that any one has
the right to pass a definite judgment on my meaning; for one does not
learn to ride by reading a book on horsemanship, and eurhythmics are
above all a matter of personal experience.</p>

<p>The object of the method is, in the first instance, to create by the
help of rhythm a rapid and regular current of communication between
brain and body; and what differentiates my physical exercises from those
of present-day methods of muscular development is that each of them is
conceived in the form which can most quickly establish in the brain the
image of the movement studied.</p>

<p>It is a question of eliminating in every muscular movement, by the
help of will, the untimely intervention <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
20]</span>of muscles useless for the movement in question, and thus
developing attention, consciousness and will-power. Next must be created
an automatic technique for all those muscular movements which do not
need the help of the consciousness, so that the latter may be reserved
for those forms of expression which are purely intelligent. Thanks to
the co-ordination of the nerve-centres, to the formation and development
of the greatest possible number of motor habits, my method assures the
freest possible play to subconscious expression. The creation in the
organism of a rapid and easy means of communication between thought and
its means of expression by movements allows the personality free play,
giving it character, strength and life to an extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia is often nothing else than intellectual confusion produced
by the inability of the nervous system to obtain from the muscular
system regular obedience to the order from the brain. Training the nerve
centres, establishing order in the organism, is the only remedy for
intellectual perversion produced by lack of will power and by the
incomplete subjection of body to mind. Unable to obtain physical
realization of its ideas, the brain amuses itself in forming images
without hope of realizing them, drops the real for the unreal, and
substitutes vain and vague speculation for the free and healthy union of
mind and body.</p>

<p>The first result of a thorough rhythmic training is that the pupil
sees clearly in himself what he really is, and obtains from his powers
all the advantage possible. This result seems to me one which should
attract the attention of all educationalists and assure to
education <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 21]</span>by and for rhythm an
important place in general culture.</p>

<p>But, as an artist, I wish to add, that the second result of this
education ought to be to put the completely developed faculties of the
individual at the service of art and to give the latter the most subtle
and complete of interpreters&mdash;the human body. For the body can become a
marvellous instrument of beauty and harmony when it vibrates in tune
with artistic imagination and collaborates with creative thought. It is
not enough that, thanks to special exercises, students of music should
have corrected their faults and be no longer in danger of spoiling their
musical interpretations by their lack of physical skill and harmonious
movements; it is necessary in addition that the music which lives within
them&mdash;artists will understand me&mdash;should obtain free and complete
development, and that the rhythms which inspire their personality should
enter into intimate communion with those which animate the works to be
interpreted.</p>

<p>The education of the nervous system must be of such a nature that the
suggested rhythms of a work of art induce in the individual analogous
vibrations, produce a powerful reaction in him and change naturally into
rhythms of expression. In simpler language, the body must become capable
of responding to artistic rhythms and of realizing them quite naturally
without fear of exaggeration.</p>

<p>This faculty of emotion, indispensable to the artist, was formerly
natural to almost all beginners in music, for hardly any but
pre-destined artists devoted them<span class="pagenum">[Pg.
22]</span>selves to the art; but, if this is no longer the case, it is
possible at least to awaken dulled faculties, to develop and co-ordinate
them, and it is the duty of every musical educationalist to deter from
instrumental technique every individual who is still without musical
feeling.</p>

<p>The experimental study of rhythm should form a part of every
well-organized musical education, and this study will be useful not only
to musicians, but to music itself. It is quite certain that, if since
Beethoven's time harmony has developed, if each generation has created
fresh groupings of sounds, it is not the same regarding rhythmic forms,
which remain much as they were.</p>

<p>I shall be told that the means of expression are of no importance so
long as the artist is able to show his meaning, that a sincere emotion
can be clearly expressed even with old-fashioned rhythms, and that to
try and create new rhythms is mere technical work, and to enforce such
upon the composers of to-morrow is simply depriving them of their
character. This is all true, and I myself have a horror of seeking new
means of expression within the limits of hard and fast rules, for
expression ought to be a spontaneous manifestation. But I assert that
experiments in rhythm, and the complete study of movements simple and
combined, ought to create a fresh mentality, that artists thus trained
will find inevitably and spontaneously new rhythmic forms to express
their feelings, and that in consequence their characters will be able to
develop more completely and with greater strength. It is a fact that
very young children taught by my method invent quite
naturally <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 23]</span>physical rhythms such as
would have occurred to very few professional musicians, and that my most
advanced pupils find monotonous many contemporary works the rhythmic
poverty of which shocks neither public nor critics.</p>

<p>I will terminate this short sketch of my system by pointing out the
intimate relations which exist between movements in time and movements
in space, between rhythms in sound and rhythm in the body, between Music
and Plastic Expression.</p>

<p>Gestures and attitudes of the body complete, animate and enliven any
rhythmic music written simply and naturally without special regard to
tone, and, just as in painting there exist side by side a school of the
nude and a school of landscape, so in music there may be developed, side
by side, plastic music and music pure and simple. In the school of
landscape painting emotion is created entirely by combinations of moving
light and by the rhythms thus caused. In the school of the nude, which
pictures the many shades of expression of the human body, the artist
tries to show the human soul as expressed by physical forms, enlivened
by the emotions of the moment, and at the same time the characteristics
suitable to the individual and his race, such as they appear through
momentary physical modifications.</p>

<p>In the same way, plastic music will picture human feelings expressed by
gesture and will model its sound forms on those of rhythms derived
directly from expressive movements of the human body.</p>

<p>To compose the music which the Greeks appear to have realized, and
for which Goethe and Schiller hoped, <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
24]</span>musicians must have acquired experience of physical movements;
this, however, is certainly not the case to-day, for music has become
beyond all others an intellectual art. While awaiting this
transformation, present generations can apply education by and for
rhythm to the interpretation of plastic stage music such as Richard
Wagner has imagined. At the present day this music is not interpreted at
all, for dramatic singers, stage managers and conductors do not
understand the relation existing between gesture and music, and the
absolute ignorance regarding plastic expression which characterizes the
lyric actors of our day is a real profanation of scenic musical art. Not
only are singers allowed to walk and gesticulate on the stage without
paying any attention to the time, but also no shade of expression,
dynamic or motor, of the orchestra&mdash;crescendo, decrescendo,
accelerando, rallentando&mdash;finds in their gestures adequate
realization. By this I mean the kind of wholly instinctive
transformation of sound movements into bodily movements such as my
method teaches.</p>

<p>Authors, poets, musicians and painters cannot demand from the
interpreters of their works knowledge of the relations between movements
in time and in space, for this knowledge can only be developed by
special studies. No doubt a few poets and painters have an inborn
knowledge of the rhythms of space; for instance, Hugo von Hofmannsthal,
the stage mounter of "Electra" at the Vienna Opera, who constructed a
huge staircase, on which, however, the actors, having little
acquaintance with the most elementary notions of balance, moved with
deplorable heavi<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 25]</span>ness; or again, the
aesthetician Adolphe Appia, whose remarkable work <i>Music and Stage
Mounting</i> ought to be the guide of all stage managers. But the
majority of composers write their plastic music without knowing whether
it is capable of being practically realized, without personal experience
of the laws of weight, force and bodily movement.</p>

<p>My hope is, that sincere artists desirous of perfection and seeking
progress will study seriously the grave question which I raise. For my
own part, relying on many experiments, and full of confidence in ideas
carefully thought out, I have devoted my life to the teaching of rhythm,
being fully satisfied that, thanks to it, man will regain his natural
powers of expression, and at the same time his full motor faculties, and
that art has everything to hope from new generations brought up in the
cult of harmony, of physical and mental health, of order, beauty and
truth.</p>

EMILE JAQUES-DALCROZE</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 26]</span>(<span class="smcap">Lecture at Leipzig, December 10, 1911</span>)</p>

<p>The objection is often raised that under my system the technique of an
instrument is acquired too late. But this objection has no foundation in
fact. A child who begins rhythmic gymnastics as I would have it in its
fifth or sixth year and a year later ear-training, can certainly have
piano lessons when eight years old, and I can state from experience that
the finger technique of the child will then develop much more quickly,
for the musical faculties in general will have been far better
developed, more thoroughly trained and become more part of the child's
life owing to the preliminary training.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lessons in rhythmic gymnastics help children in their other lessons,
for they develop the powers of observation, of analyzing, of
understanding and of memory, thus making them more orderly and
precise.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The effect of rhythmic training on the time-table and life of a
school is like that of a hot water heating system which spreads an equal
warmth through all parts of a building. Teachers of other subjects will
find that such training provides them with pupils more
re<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 27]</span>sponsive, more elastic and of
more character than they otherwise would be. Therefore, the study of
rhythm, as well as education by means of rhythm, ought to be most
closely connected with school life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="subtitle">(<span class="smcap">Address to the Dresden
Teachers' Association, May 28, 1912</span>)</p>

<p>From many years' experience of music teaching I have gradually produced
a method which gives a child musical experiences instead of musical
knowledge.</p>

<p>I expect much from education in rhythm in elementary schools, provided
it be given regularly, completely and sufficiently. The exercises should
be begun at the age of six, with half an hour's lesson three times a
week, but these lessons can quite well be taken from playtime. By the
age of twelve two lessons a week are sufficient. This training will not
only develop the feeling for beauty and form by accustoming the eye to
distinguish beautiful movements and lines from those that are ugly, but
also render the children susceptible to musical impressions.</p>

<p>There are always children who are not able to sing in time, or even
to beat time, to walk in time, or to graduate the strength and rapidity
of their movements. Such children are unrhythmic, and it will generally
be noticed that these children are stiff and awkward, often also
over-excitable. This lack of rhythm is almost like a disease. It is
caused by the lack of balance between the mental and physical powers,
which <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 28]</span>results from insufficient
co-ordination between the mental picture of a movement and its
performance by the body, and these nervous troubles are just as much the
cause as the result of such lack of harmony. In some cases the brain
gives clear and definite impulses, but the limbs, in themselves healthy,
can do nothing because the nervous system is in confusion. In other
cases the limbs have lost the power to carry out orders sent by the
brain, and the undischarged nerve-impulses disturb the whole nervous
system. In other cases again, muscles and nerves are healthy, but
insufficient training in rhythm impedes the formation of lasting
rhythmic images in the brain. To repeat, the causes of this lack of
rhythm all lie in the important but insufficiently recognized
psycho-physiological sphere of the co-ordination of brain, nerve-paths
and muscles.</p>

<p>The objection is sometimes made that rhythmic gymnastics cause
nerve-strain in children. This is not the case. Several brain
specialists have told me that they have effected satisfactory cures with
rhythmic gymnastic exercises.</p>

<p>Rhythm is infinite, therefore the possibilities for physical
representations of rhythm are infinite.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="subtitle">(<span class="smcap">Address to
Students</span>, <i>der Rhythmus</i>, Vol. I, p. 41, <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>I consider it unpardonable that in teaching the piano the whole
attention should be given to the imitative <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
29]</span>faculties, and that the pupil should have no opportunity
whatever of expressing his own musical impressions with the technical
means which are taught him.</p>

<p>Whether the teacher himself be a genius is of little importance,
provided he is able to help others to develop their own talents.</p>

<p>One can create nothing of lasting value without self-knowledge. The only
living art is that which grows out of one's own experiences. It is just
the same with teaching; it is quite impossible to develop others until
one has proved one's own powers in every direction, until one has learnt
to conquer oneself, to make oneself better, to suppress bad tendencies,
to strengthen good ones, and, in the place of the primitive being, to
make one more complete who, having consciously formed himself, knows his
powers. Only in proportion as one develops oneself is one able to help
others to develop.</p>

<p>I consider that one does not require to be a genius in order to teach
others, but that one certainly does require strong conviction,
enthusiasm, persistence and joy in life. All these qualities are equally
derived from the control and knowledge of self.</p>

<p>We must, from youth upwards, learn that we are masters of our fate,
that heredity is powerless if we realize that we can conquer it, that
our future depends upon the victory which we gain over ourselves.
However weak the individual may be, his help is required to
pre<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 30]</span>pare a way for a better future.
Life and growth are one and the same, and it is our duty by the example
of our lives to develop those who come after us. Let us therefore assume
the responsibility which Nature puts upon us, and consider it our duty
to regenerate ourselves; thus shall we help the growth of a more
beautiful humanity.</p>

<p>I like joy, for it is life. I preach joy, for it alone gives the power
of creating useful and lasting work. Amusement, an excitement which
stimulates the nerves instead of uplifting the spirit, is not necessary
in the life of the artist. Of course one must often let oneself go, and
I should be the last to defend a so-called moral discipline, or a
pedantic rule of monastic severity. For a healthy, active person the joy
of the daily struggle and of work performed with enthusiasm should be
sufficient to beautify life, drive away fatigue and illuminate present
and future. This condition of joy is brought about in us by the feeling
of freedom and responsibility, by the clear perception of the creative
power in us, by the balance of our natural powers, by the harmonious
rhythm between intention and deed. It depends upon our creative
faculties, both natural and acquired, and becomes greater as these grow.
The power of understanding ourselves certainly gives us a sense of
freedom, for it opens a rapid correspondence, not only between
imagination and power of performance, between apperception and feelings,
but also between the various kinds of feelings which dwell in us.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JAQUES-DALCROZE_METHOD"

<h3 class="subtitle">I. GROWTH<a name="FNanchor_1_2"
id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_2"
id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> For much of the
material of this chapter the writer is indebted to Herr Karl Storck, of
Berlin, to whose book <i>E. Jaques-Dalcroze, seine Stellung und Aufgabe
in unserer Zeit</i>, Stuttgart, 1912, Greiner &amp; Pfeiffer, the reader
is directed.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 31]</span>Emile Jaques-Dalcroze was born
in Vienna on July 6, 1865, of mixed parentage, his father being a Swiss
from St. Croix in the Jura (hence the artist name Dalcroze), his mother
of German extraction. At the age of eight his parents brought him to
Geneva, where in due course he became a student at the Conservatoire of
Music. His musical education was continued in Paris under L&eacute;o
Delibes and in Vienna under Bruckner and Fuchs. For a short period his
studies were interrupted by an engagement as musical director of a small
theatre in Algiers&mdash;an opportunity which he used for study of the
peculiar rhythms of Arab popular music, which he found unusually
interesting and stimulating.</p>

<p>Returning to Geneva, he earned, by a life of varied activities as
teacher, writer and composer, a standing which in 1892 brought him the
appointment of Professor of Harmony at the Geneva Conservatoire.</p>

<p>The wider experience which the new sphere of work brought was to a
certain extent a disappointment, for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 32]</span>with it came clear evidence of what
had before only been suspected, namely, that the education of future
professional musicians was in many ways radically wrong, in that the
training of individual faculties was made the chief object, without
consideration of whether or no these faculties stood in any close
relation to the inner consciousness of the student. In other words, the
aim of the training was to form means of expression, without
consideration of what was to be expressed, to produce a highly trained
instrument, without thought of the art whose servant it was to be, to
take as primary object a thing of secondary importance, indeed only of
importance at all when consequent on something which the usual training
entirely neglected. The students were taught to play instruments, to
sing songs, but without any thought of such work becoming a means of
self expression and so it was found that pupils, technically far
advanced, after many years of study were unable to deal with the
simplest problems in rhythm and that their sense for pitch, relative or
absolute, was most defective; that, while able to read accurately or to
play pieces memorized, they, had not the slightest power of giving
musical expression to their simplest thoughts or feelings, in fact were
like people who possess the vocabulary of a language and are able to
read what others have written, yet are unable to put their own simple
thoughts and impressions into words. The analogy here is the simplest
use of everyday language; from this to the art of the essayist or poet
is far; so in music&mdash;one who has mastered notes, chords and rhythms
can give musical expression to simple thoughts
and <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 33]</span>feelings, while to become a
composer he must traverse a road that only natural talent can render
easy.</p>

<p>Jaques-Dalcroze took the view that technique should be nothing but a
means to art, that the aim of musical education should be, not the
production of pianists, violinists, singers, but of musically developed
human beings, and that therefore the student should not begin by
specializing on any instrument, but by developing his musical faculties,
thus producing a basis for specialized study. This training could only
be obtained by awakening the sense, natural though often latent, for the
ultimate bases of music, namely, <i>tone</i> and <i>rhythm</i>. As the sense for
tone could only be developed through the ear, he now gave special
attention to vocal work, and noticed that when the students themselves
beat time to their singing, the work became much more real, that the
pupils had a feeling of being physically in unison with the music,
indeed the feeling of producing something complete and beautiful.
Following up this hint, "Gesture Songs" were written, which, it was
found, were performed with surprising ease.</p>

<p>Up to this point movement had only been used as an accompaniment to
music, not as a means of expressing it; the next step was to give the
body a training so refined and so detailed as to make it sensitive to
every rhythmic impulse and able to lose itself in any music. This
co-ordination of movement and music is the essence of the
Jaques-Dalcroze method, and differentiates it from all other methods of
similar aim.</p>

<p>So far only arm movements had been employed, and those merely the
conventional ones of the conductor. <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
34]</span>The next step was to devise a series of arm movements,
providing a means of clearly marking all tempi from two beats in the bar
to twelve beats in the bar, including such forms as 5/4 7/4 9/4
11/4, and a system of movements of the body and lower limbs to
represent time values from any number of notes to the beat up to whole
notes of twelve beats to the note. From the first the work aroused keen
interest among the students and their parents, and the master was given
enthusiastic help by them in all his experiments; above all he was
loyally aided by his assistant, Fr&auml;ulein Nina Gorter. The
Conservatoire authorities, however, were not sympathetic, and it became
necessary to form a volunteer-experimental class, which worked outside
official hours and buildings.</p>

<p>The first public recognition of the method was at the Music Festival
in Solothurn in 1905, where a demonstration was given which made a
striking impression on those present. The value of the method for the
elementary education of musicians was immediately recognized and some
slight idea obtained of the part it might play in general elementary
education. It has been made clear that the method had its origin in the
attempt to give life and reality to musical education, to give a
foundational development on which specialized music study could be
based, and that it had grown naturally and gradually as the result of
observation and experiment. Now it began to be apparent that something
still greater than the original aim had been achieved, that the system
evolved was one which, pro<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 35]</span>perly
used, might be of enormous value in the education of children. With
characteristic energy Jaques-Dalcroze, inspired by the new idea, took up
the study of psychology, in which he was helped by his friend, the
psychologist Clapar&egrave;de, who early saw the value which the new
ideas might have in educational practice. The change of outlook which
now took place in the master's mind can best be made clear by a
translation of his own words.<a name="FNanchor_1_3"
id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_3"
id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Address to
students, Dresden, 1911 (<i>Der Rhythmus</i>, vol. i, p.
33).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"It is true that I first devised my method as a musician for musicians.
But the further I carried my experiments, the more I noticed that, while
a method intended to develop the sense for rhythm, and indeed based on
such development, is of great importance in the education of a musician,
its chief value lies in the fact that it trains the powers of
apperception and of expression in the individual and renders easier the
externalization of natural emotions. Experience teaches me that a man is
not ready for the specialized study of an art until his character is
formed, and his powers of expression developed."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1906 was held the first training-course for teachers; how the method
has since grown can be realized by noting that a fortnight was then
considered a sufficient period of training, whilst now the teachers'
course at Hellerau requires from one to three years' steady work. In the
years 1907-9 the short teachers' courses were repeated; in the latter
year the first diploma was granted, experience having shown the need of
this, for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 36]</span>already individuals in all parts of
the world, after but a few days' training, in some cases after merely
being spectators at lessons, were advertising themselves as teachers of
the method. In 1910 Jaques-Dalcroze was invited by the brothers Wolf and
Harald Dohrn to come to Dresden, where, in the garden suburb of
Hellerau, they have built him a College for Rhythmic Training, a true
Palace of Rhythm.</p>


<h3>II. PRACTICE<a name="FNanchor_1_4"
id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_4"
id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In the
preparation of this chapter free use has been made of the writings of M.
Jaques-Dalcroze and of Dr. Wolf Dohrn, Director of the College of Music
and Rhythm, Hellerau, Dresden.</p></blockquote>

<p>The method naturally falls into three divisions&mdash;</p>

<ul class="center">
<li>(<i>a</i>) Rhythmic gymnastics proper.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Ear training.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Improvisation (practical harmony).</li>
</ul>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Is essentially the Jaques-Dalcroze method&mdash;that which is
fundamentally new. As it is this part of the method which is likely to
prove of great value in all systems of education, not merely as a
preparation for the study of music, but as a means to the utmost
development of faculty in the individual, it will be dealt with in
detail.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Is of the greatest importance as an adjunct to rhythmic
gymnastics, since it is through the ear that rhythm-impressions are most
often and most easily obtained. Jaques-Dalcroze naturally uses his own
methods of ear-training, which are extremely successful, but he does not
lay stress on them; he does, how<span class="pagenum">[Pg.
37]</span>ever, emphasize the need of such training, whatever the
method, as shall give the pupil an accurate sense of pitch, both
absolute and relative, and a feeling for tonality. The more these are
possessed the greater the use which can be made of rhythmic
gymnastics.</p>

<div><img id="img05" class="center" src="images/img05.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">Beating 4/4.</p>

<div><img id="img06" class="center" src="images/img06.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption"> Movements for the Semibreve.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This is not required in the <i>pupil</i>, however valuable it may be as
an additional means of self-expression; it is, however, absolutely
necessary for the successful <i>teacher</i> of rhythmic gymnastics, who must
be able to express, on some instrument&mdash;most conveniently the
piano&mdash;whatever rhythms, simple or compound, he may wish to use in the
training of his pupils. This subject, therefore, naturally forms an
important part of the normal course at the Hellerau College, since this
course is planned to meet the needs of students preparing for the
teaching diploma in Eurhythmics. Here, too, Jaques-Dalcroze has his own
system, with which he obtains results often remarkable, but, as in the
case of the ear-training, this is a detail not peculiar to the method as
a whole.</p>

<p>To repeat: the essentials are that the teacher have the power of free
expression on some musical instrument, the pupil that of hearing
correctly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The system of exercises known as rhythmic gymnastics is based upon
two ideas, (i) <i>time</i> is shown by movements of the arms,
(ii) <i>time-values</i>, i.e., note-duration, by movements of the feet
and body. In the early stages of the training this principle is clearly
observed; later it may be varied in many ingenious
ways, <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 38]</span>for instance in what is known
as plastic counterpoint, where the actual notes played are represented
by movements of the arms, while the counterpoint in crotchets, quavers
or semiquavers, is given by the feet.</p>

<p>The system of beating time with the arms provides for all tempi from
2/4 to 12/4 and includes 5/4 7/4 9/4.</p>

<p>In the series of movements to represent note-values the crotchet is
taken as the unit; this is represented by a step; higher values, from
the minim to the whole note of twelve beats, are represented by a step
with one foot and a movement or movements with the other foot or with
the body, but without progression, e.g., a minim by one step and a knee
bend, a dotted minim by a step and two movements without progression, a
whole note of twelve beats by a step and eleven movements. Thus for each
note in the music there is one step, one progression in space, while at
the same time the note, if of greater length than a crotchet, is
analysed into crotchets.</p>

<p>Notes of shorter duration than the crotchet, i.e., quavers, triplets,
etc., are expressed also by steps which become quicker in proportion to
their frequency.</p>

<p>When the movements corresponding to the notes from the crotchet to the
whole note of twelve beats have, with all their details, become a habit,
the pupil need only make them mentally, contenting himself with one step
forward. This step will have the exact length of the whole note, which
will be mentally analysed into its various elements. Although these
elements are not individually performed by the body, their images and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 39]</span>the innervations suggested by those
images take the place of the movements.</p>

<p>The process is similar to that of the child learning to read; at first
it reads aloud, then to itself, still, however, moving its lips, i.e.,
still making all the innervations necessary for the pronunciation of
the words. Only after much practice does the process become sufficiently
automatic for these lip and tongue innervations to be dropped. Indeed,
many adults show traces of them when they read. To what degree our power
to read is based upon such innervations is shown by the fact that old
people, as their inhibitory powers become weaker, often revert to making
these lip movements. From this we may conclude that such innervations,
although they do not find their natural expression, still exist and have
effect, i.e., they are necessary. The Jaques-Dalcroze method aims at
nothing more or less than the training of rhythmic innervations.</p>

<p>The whole training aims at developing the power of rapid physical
reaction to mental impressions. These latter are more commonly obtained
through the ear, chiefly from the music played; naturally, however, the
teacher needs at times to give commands during an exercise. For this
purpose he invariably uses the word <i>hopp</i>, a word chosen for its clear
incisiveness.</p>

<p>Before each exercise it is clearly stated what the word is to
represent in that particular case, e.g., omit one beat, omit one bar,
beat time twice as fast with the arms, etc.; often the word will be used
in series in an exercise, each <i>hopp</i> meaning some additional
change. As the command generally falls on the second half
of <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 40]</span>the beat preceding the one in
which the change is to be made, very rapid mental and physical response
is necessary, especially if the music be at all quick. Exercises of this
class soon give the power of rapid muscular innervation and inhibition,
and are of extraordinary value in education, quite apart from their
purely rhythmic side.</p>

<p>We will now consider the exercises in some detail, taking, as a matter
of convenience, the order and grouping generally adopted at
demonstrations of the method. In actual practice such strict grouping is
neither possible nor necessary; the actual form which the lessons take
will depend upon the genius of teacher and pupils, the possibilities of
variety being infinite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOVEMENTS TO INDICATE VARIOUS TEMPI</div>

<p>Simple music is played to which the pupils march. As they grasp the
beat they mark it by an accented step; when this becomes easy, the
corresponding arm movements are added, and the strong beat, at this
stage always the first, is marked by full contraction of the arm
muscles. Practice is given until at <i>hopp</i> the pupil can stop
suddenly, discontinue accenting with one or both arms or with one or
both feet, substitute an arm-movement for a foot movement, insert an
extra accent either with arm or foot, or do any similar thing previously
agreed on. By repeated practice of such exercises complete automatic
control of the limbs is obtained and the ground prepared for more
advanced work. It is at this stage that the simple movements to indicate
times and notes are learnt; they may be <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
41]</span>likened to the alphabet of the method, the elementary
exercises as a whole being its accidence, the more advanced stages,
including plastic expression, its syntax.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAINING IN METRE</div>

<p>This group of exercises is a natural extension of those preceding.</p>

<p>The pupil learns a series of movements which together form a rhythm,
first practising them singly, then in groups, the signal for the change
being always the word <i>hopp</i>. By means of such exercises the component
movements required in the physical expression of a rhythm can be learnt,
first individually, then in series, until the complete rhythm can be
expressed and the use of <i>hopp</i> be dropped, each change of movement
becoming itself the signal for the next.</p>

<p>Again, the pupil learns to realize<a name="FNanchor_1_5"
id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a
rhythm played on the piano or indicated by the movements of another
person. This is something quite apart from mere imitation; trained by
previous exercises, the pupil first forms clear mental images of the
movements corresponding to the rhythm in question and then gives
physical expression to those images. In other words, he does not
reproduce until he has understood; in fact, without understanding,
correct reproduction of a lengthy series of such movements is
impossible. In the same way, an individual cannot easily remember and
repeat a succession of words which he does not understand, but can
repeat without difficulty a long series of words of which he understands
the sense. Indeed, the importance of many of these exercises becomes
clearer when the way <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 42]</span>in which
children are taught to read and write is remembered.</p>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_5"
id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Realize</i>
is used in rhythmic gymnastics in the sense <i>express by movements of
the body</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oral and visual images of letters and words are impressed on the child
by reading aloud, and in this way the young brain easily masters the
difficult work of reading and writing. The Jaques-Dalcroze method
proceeds in exactly the same manner as regards the elements of music.</p>

<p>When we have once realized this point, we are bound to wonder why music
teaching has not always been based on this elementary and unfailing
form. What would be said to teachers who tried to teach children to read
and write without letting them spell and read aloud? But this is what
has often been done in the teaching of music, and if children generally
show but little pleasure and interest in their first music lessons, the
fault does not lie with them but with our wrong method of making the
elements clear to them.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we generally do not make the latter clear to them,
and fail in the most important duty of the educator and teacher, namely,
that of making the child really experience what he is to learn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL RESPONSE</div>

<p>A rhythm in music consists of a regularly recurring series of
accented sounds, unaccented sounds, and rests, expressed in rhythmic
gymnastics by movements and inhibitions of movements. Individuals who
are rhythmically uncertain generally have a muscular system which is
irregularly responsive to mental stimuli; the response may be too rapid
or too slow; in either case impulse or inhibition falls at the wrong
mo<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 43]</span>ment, the change of movement is
not made to time, and the physical expression of the rhythm is
blurred.</p>

<p>Although feeling for rhythm is more or less latent in us all and can be
developed, few have it naturally perfect. The method has many exercises
which are of use in this connexion. By means of these the pupil is
taught how to arrest movement suddenly or slowly, to move alternately
forwards or backwards, to spring at a given signal, to lie down or
stand up in the exact time of a bar of music&mdash;in each case with a
minimum of muscular effort and without for a moment losing the feeling
for each time-unit of the music.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MENTAL HEARING. CONCENTRATION</div>

<p>Physical movements repeatedly performed create corresponding images in
the brain; the stronger the feeling for the movement, i.e., the more the
pupil concentrates while making that movement, the clearer will be the
corresponding mental image, and the more fully will the sense for metre
and rhythm be developed.</p>

<p>We might say that these movement images store up the innervations which
bring about the actual movement. They are for the body and its movements
what formul&aelig; are for the mathematician.</p>

<p>Developed out of many movements they become a complete symbol for the
rhythm expressed by the series of movements in question. Thus the pupil
who knows how to march in time to a given rhythm has only to close his
eyes and recall a clear image of the corresponding movements to
experience the rhythm as clearly as if he were expressing it by
marching. He simply continues to perform the movements mentally. If,
ho<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 44]</span>wever, his movements when
actually realizing the rhythm are weak or confused, the corresponding
mental images will be vague or incorrect, whilst movements which are
dynamically clear guarantee the accuracy of the corresponding mental
images and nerve-impulses.</p>

<p>In practice the exercise consists in first mastering a rhythm played,
marching and beating time in the usual manner, then at <i>hopp</i>
discontinuing all movement, either for a number of bars previously
agreed upon or until the signal to resume is given by a second <i>hopp</i>.
In this exercise the teacher ceases to play at the first <i>hopp</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANALYSIS AND DIVISION OF TIME VALUES</div>

<p>The exercises of this group are designed to teach how to subdivide units
of time into parts of varying number. At <i>hopp</i> the crotchet must be
divided into quavers, triplets, semiquavers, etc., as may have been
previously arranged, or instead of <i>hopp</i> the teacher may call <i>three</i>,
<i>four</i>, etc., to indicate the subdivision which is to be expressed by
the corresponding number of steps. Apart from their direct object, the
exercises of this group are of value for the training which they give in
poise; they might be classed equally well with the group under
<i>Development of Mental Response</i>.</p>

<p>Here, too, belong exercises in the realization of syncopation in
which, as the note is represented by the usual step, it comes off the
beat, the latter being indicated by a knee-bend which, in quick time,
becomes a mere suggestion of movement or is omitted, e.g.,
<img src="images/045.png" alt="Music Staff"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></p>

<p>These exercises in syncopation are perhaps some of the most difficult
in the method, as they demand an <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
45]</span>extraordinary control of inhibition. Individuals of musical
ability often find them difficult at first, and their easy performance
may be taken as evidence of a developed feeling for rhythm. As a rule
children find these exercises easier than do adults.</p>

<p class="caption">Beating 5/4 in canon with expression.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REALIZATION OF TIME AND RHYTHM</div>

<p>The object here is to express by rhythmic movements and without
hesitation rhythms perceived by the ear. The exactness of such
expression will be in proportion to the number of movements of which the
pupil has acquired automatic control. There is not time to analyse the
music heard; the body must <i>realize</i> before the mind has a clear
impression of the movement image, just as in reading, words are
understood and pronounced without a clear mental image of them being
formed.</p>

<p>When the realization of a rhythm heard has become relatively easy, the
pupil is taught to concentrate, by listening to, and forming a mental
image of, a fresh rhythm while still performing the old one. In this
manner he obtains facility in rendering automatic, groups of movements
rhythmically arranged, and in keeping the mind free to take a fresh
impression which in its turn can be rendered automatic.</p>

<p>Here again the process is analagous to that of reading, in which, while
we are grasping the meaning of a sentence, the eye is already dealing
with the next, preparing it in turn for comprehension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF THE LIMBS</div>

<p>Characteristic exercises of this group are: beating the same time
with both arms but in canon, beating two different tempi with the arms
while the feet march to one or <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
46]</span>other or perhaps march to yet a third time, e.g., the arms
3/4 and 4/4, the feet 5/4. There are, also, exercises in the
analysis of a given time unit into various fractions simultaneously,
e.g., in a 6/8 bar one arm may beat three to the bar, the other arm
two, while the feet march six.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOUBLE OR TRIPLE DEVELOPMENT OF RHYTHMS</div>

<p>These exercises are a physical preparation for what is known in music as
the development of a theme. While the composers of fugues always use a
double or quadruple development, the method introduces an entirely fresh
element&mdash;the triple development, exercises in which are difficult but
extremely valuable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLASTIC COUNTERPOINT AND COMPOUND RHYTHMS</div>

<p>In plastic counterpoint the arms realize the theme, i.e., make as many
movements as there are notes, whilst the feet mark the counterpoint in
crotchets, quavers, triplets or semiquavers.</p>

<p>A compound rhythm may be realized by the arms taking one rhythm, the
feet another; or the rhythms of a three part canon may be expressed by
simultaneous singing, beating with the arms and marching.</p>

<p>These exercises correspond in the sphere of physical expression to the
technical exercises of instrumental work, for they teach the pupil to
express simultaneously impressions of the most varying nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRADATION OF MUSCULAR EFFORT. PATHETIC ACCENT.
PLASTIC EXPRESSION</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 47]</span>The exercises already dealt with
have all the general purpose of developing feeling for rhythm by giving
training in the physical expression of rhythms. Those in this last group
aim at facility in making crescendos and decrescendos of innervation, in
passing from one shade of expression to another, in co-ordinating
movements, not only to the rhythm of the music played, but also to its
feeling; they allow free play to individuality, to temperament, and give
opportunity for that free self-expression for which the preceding
exercises have provided facility.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSONS_AT_HELLERAU" id="LESSONS_AT_HELLERAU"></a>LESSONS AT HELLERAU</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 48]</span>Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze's
lessons are full of vitality and entertainment, combined with the
serious work in hand. No slacking is possible. He will perhaps open a
rhythmic gymnastic lesson by playing a vigorous theme of one or two bars
in a rhythm such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><img src="images/051.png" alt="Musica Rhythm" /></p>

<p>which, as soon as it is grasped by the pupils, they begin to
<i>realize</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_6"
id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that is, to mark the tempo with the arms, and to move the feet according
to the notes. A note which contains more than one beat&mdash;for
instance, the minim in the first bar&mdash;is shown by taking one step
forward for the first beat and by a slight bend of the knee for the
second beat. The next two crochets are represented by one step for each.
A step is also taken for each quaver, but twice as quickly; for the
dotted crochet, a step and a slight spring before the last
quaver&mdash;all this while the arms are beating a steady four. After a
short practice of these two bars, the master will glide into yet another
rhythm, the pupils still realizing the first one, but at the same time
listening and mentally registering the one being played, so as to be
ready on the instant at the word of command, which is <i>hopp</i>, to
change to the new rhythm. We will suppose it to be as follows
<img src="images/051b.png" alt="Music Rhythm" />.
This, it will be noticed, is in 3/4 <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
49]</span>time. The pupils become accustomed to dropping frequently into
various times with the greatest ease. The three bars would then be
realized consecutively, and this process will continue until perhaps
there are six bars in all. These must all be so clear in the minds of
the pupils, that at the word of command, one bar, or two bars, can be
omitted on the instant, or be realized twice as quickly, or twice as
slowly; or what is still more complicated, the arms can beat the time
twice as slowly and the feet mark the notes twice as quickly. It seems
incredibly difficult to do at first, but the same training of
<i>thinking to time</i> occurs in every lesson, in improvisation and solf&egrave;ge,
as well as in the rhythmic gymnastic lessons, and so the invaluable
habits of concentrated thinking, of quick and definite action, and of
control of mind over body, become established.</p>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_6"

<p class="caption">The Air Bath.</p>

<div><img id="img10" class="center" src="images/img10.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">The College: Entrance Hall.</p>

<p>Each lesson is varied to a remarkable degree; in fact, Monsieur
Jaques-Dalcroze seldom repeats himself. Every day he has new ideas,
consisting of new movements, or of new uses for old ones, so that there
is never a dull moment. It must be understood, however, that the
alphabet and grammar of the movements remain the same, it is the
combinations of them that are limitless. The music is, of course, always
improvised.</p>

<p>A word should be said on the subject of feeling two different rhythms
at the same time. Every teacher knows the difficulty children have in
playing three notes against four on the piano. The Hellerau children can
with ease beat four with one arm and three with the other, or beat three
with the arms and two or four with the feet, or <i>vice versa</i>. And
this is not learnt in <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 50]</span>any
mechanical way; the power for <i>feeling</i> two rhythms simultaneously
is developed. Advanced pupils can realize three rhythms at the same
time. They will perhaps mark one with the arms, another with the feet,
and sing yet a third.</p>

<p>Another part of the work is to teach the pupils to express the type of
music that is being played; this is technically known as "Plastic
expression." The alphabet of this consists of twenty gestures with the
arms, which can be done in many various combinations and in various
positions, and by means of these any kind of emotion can be expressed.
Perhaps the music will begin by being solemn and grand, becoming even
tragic, and gradually the tones and melody will rise to cheerfulness,
the rhythm will become more animated and the tone swell out again until
a perfect ecstasy of joy is reached&mdash;and all the while the figures of
the pupils are harmonising absolutely with the music, trained as they
are to listen accurately to every note, every accent, every change of
key and, above all, every rhythm. To the watcher such an exercise is
effective and striking in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Realizing syncopated passages is a fine exercise for developing
independence of movement in the arms and feet, as the feet move in
between the beats of the arms. Let any one try to realize a simple
measure in syncopation. For instance, take a bar of 4/4 time
<img src="images/055.png" alt="Music Rhythm" />.
The first beat of the arms and the first step will come together, the
second beat of the arms will come half-way between the second and third
steps, the third beat <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 51]</span>half-way
between the third and fourth steps, and the fourth beat half-way between
the fourth and fifth steps, and this should be done with no contraction
of muscle or appearance of effort.</p>

<p>Other exercises consist of beating various times in canon, that is,
one arm beginning one beat later than the other; of beating different
times with each arm, perhaps seven with one arm and three with the
other; of marching to one rhythm and beating time to another; of simple
marching and at the word of command taking one step backward, and then
forward again; of marching the counterpoint of a rhythm. For instance,
if the rhythm played be <img src="images/056a.png" alt="Music Rhythm" />
the counterpoint in crochets would be <img src="images/056b.png"
alt="Music Rhythm" />, or if it is to be in quavers it would be
<img src="images/056c.png" alt="Music Rhythm" />. The counterpoint can
be filled in with triplets, semiquavers, or with notes of any other
value.</p>

<p>Another good exercise is to take a simple rhythm and at the word of
command realize it twice or three times as quickly or as slowly, the
arms still beating in the first tempo. A simple example will make this
clear. <img src="images/056d.png" alt="Music Rhythm" /> twice as quickly
would become <img src="images/056e.png" alt="Music Rhythm" />.</p>

<p>The pupils are often asked to listen to what is played and then to
realize it. It may be a series of four bars, each one in a different
tempo, and all times are employed, including 5/4, 7/4, 9/3 and
others which are somewhat exceptional. And so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>From these suggestions something of the
endless <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 52]</span>variety of exercises that
may be devised can probably now be imagined.</p>

<p>As soon as movements become automatic they are used as units for
building up more elaborate movements, and no time is wasted in doing
merely mechanical exercises. In every detail of the method the brain is
called into constant activity, and, lest any one should think that it
would be easy for one pupil to copy another in doing the exercises, it
should be stated that, if such a thing were attempted, it would end in
the pupil becoming hopelessly confused, for if the mind once loses hold
of the work in process it is very difficult to pick it up again.</p>

<p>The solf&egrave;ge lessons are chiefly for ear-training and practical
harmony. In the elementary classes it is shown how scales and chords are
formed, and where the tones and semitones occur. The pupils soon become
able to tell, when three consecutive notes from any scale are played,
what degrees of the scale they are, or may be. Scales are sung always
beginning on C for every key and always to a rhythm. Here, again, the
pupils have to think to time, for in the second scale, which would be
that of F, if the flat scales were being sung, they have to remember
that they are starting on the fifth note of the scale, and that the
interval between the third and fourth notes of the scale is a semitone;
that the third and fourth degrees in the key of F are A and B, and
therefore the B has to be flattened in this scale, the other notes
remaining the same. The whole cycle of scales is sung in this manner,
each one commencing on C, or on C flat when necessary. The pupils are
also practised in listening to a scale played and
then <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 53]</span>saying in which key it is,
judging it by the fall of the semitones.</p>

<div><img id="img11" class="center" src="images/img11.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">Class Rooms.</p>

<div><img id="img12" class="center" src="images/img12.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">The College: Interiors.</p>

<p>Chords are sung analytically and in chorus, with their resolutions when
needed, and this is followed by practice in hearing and naming chords.</p>

<p>Sight singing and transposition are by no means neglected, and there is
practice in singing intervals, in singing a piece once or twice through
and then from memory, or in another key, which is not so easy to do when
the fixed <i>Do</i> is used. And always, whatever is being done, the pupils
have to be prepared for the word <i>hopp</i>, to make any change which has
been previously agreed on, e.g., to sing on the instant in a key a
semitone lower, or to sing in thought only until the next <i>hopp</i>, when
they sing aloud again. In these exercises, as in those of the rhythmic
gymnastics, there is no end of the variety of combination possible.
There is also opportunity for practice in conducting, and very
interesting it is, in a children's class, to note with what assurance a
small girl of perhaps seven or eight will beat time for the others to
sing one of their songs, and also to note the various renderings each
conductor will obtain of the same piece.</p>

<p>The improvisation on the piano is perhaps the most difficult part of
the system to master. It may not be realized by all people that <i>every
one can be taught to play original music</i>. There are cases in which
the pupil is not naturally musical, and has had no previous knowledge of
piano playing, but has learnt to improvise sufficiently well to give a
good lesson in rhythmic gymnastics, which means no small degree of
ability. This <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 54]</span>training is begun by
making use of the simplest, i.e., the common, chords, and when these are
known in every key, including those on the dominant, the pupil is
expected to improvise a short piece of eight bars, the chief feature to
be attended to being the rhythm, which has to be definite and played
without hesitation. When perfect familiarity is obtained with the common
chord of each key and with that of its dominant, another chord is
learnt, that on the sub-dominant. With these three chords alone quite
charming little pieces can be played, and gradually in this manner the
pupil has at his command passing notes, appoggiaturas, cadences, and an
unlimited number of chords and sequences. Then come the rules for
modulating from one key to another, and equal facility in all keys is
insisted on. Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze's pupils learn to improvise with
definite thought and meaning, nothing unrhythmical is ever allowed, nor
any aimless meandering over the keyboard. For these lessons the pupils
are divided into small groups of not more than six in each, and twice a
week these groups are taken altogether by Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze.</p>

<p>All branches of the work demand perfect concentration of thought and
attention, and such invaluable mental training cannot be too highly
prized, for it is fundamental to success in work of any kind, whatever
it may be.</p>

<h2><a name="LIFE_AT_HELLERAU" id="LIFE_AT_HELLERAU"></a>LIFE AT HELLERAU</h2>

<p>Surely never before has the world held better opportunities for studying
and loving the beautiful and true. One need be but a few days in
Hellerau in order to see some of the many advantages which a stay there
has to offer. For young men and women searching for a profession in
life; for those fresh from school while waiting to discover their
natural bent; for adults who seek a change from their ordinary
surroundings and who wish to improve in culture and in health; for
musicians and students in art, for teachers of dancing, and for children
of all ages, a course of study at the College in Hellerau contains
advantages and opportunities which seem to exist in no other educational
institution.</p>

<p>For the convenience of young girls there is a hall of residence, which
will accommodate about forty-six students, the head of which is a
cultured English lady of wide experience. There are also many small
houses on adjoining land, in which the male students and those who are
older can live. These may, and as a rule do, come to the Hostel for
meals.</p>

<p>The home life in the Hostel is a cheerful one. The bedrooms are
bright, containing just the necessary furniture, which of course
includes a piano. There is a large and charmingly furnished room opening
from the hall, known as the Diele, which serves as a general
sitting-room for the students. The dining-room is equally delightful,
and can be quickly converted into a ball-room for impromptu dances, or
adapted for other entertainments. <span class="pagenum">[Pg.
56]</span>There is also a library; and throughout the whole house the
same good taste is displayed. Leading from the dining-room is a large
terrace, with steps down into an attractive garden.</p>

<p>The day commences with the sounding of a gong at seven o'clock; the
house is immediately alive, and some are off to the College for a
Swedish gymnastic lesson before breakfast, others breakfast at half-past
seven and have their lesson later. There is always a half hour of
ordinary gymnastics to begin with. Then there will be a lesson in
Solf&egrave;ge, one in Rhythmic Gymnastics, and one in Improvisation, each
lasting for fifty minutes, with an interval of ten minutes between each
lesson.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 57]</span><img id="img14" class="center"
src="images/img14.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">The Hostel.</p>

<p>Dinner, which is at a quarter-past one, is followed by an hour for
rest; and at three the energetic people begin practising. The afternoons
are usually free, except twice a week, when there are lessons in
"Plastic" and dancing from four till six, before which tea is served, or
there may be extra lessons in rhythmic gymnastics for small groups of
pupils who need further help, and students may obtain the use of a room
for private practice together. In the afternoons, too, there is time and
opportunity for any other extra study or lessons which are not included
in the ordinary course, such as violin, solo singing, drawing or
painting. Most of the students soon acquire wide interests, if they do
not have them when they first come. Free afternoons may be spent in
visiting the galleries and shops of Dresden. Whenever there is anything
especially good in the way of a concert, or an opera or a classical
play, there is always a party of enthusiasts going into town for it. The
opera in Dres<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 58]</span>den, as in other parts
of Germany, fortunately begins and ends early. Late hours are not
encouraged at the Hostel&mdash;indeed, everybody is glad to retire
early, for the work is absorbing and demands plenty of energy,
especially if the full teachers' course be taken, with the hope of a
diploma at the end of two years.</p>

<p>Supper is served at a quarter-past seven, and on two evenings a week
those who wish to join the orchestral or choral societies have the
pleasure of meeting together and practising under the direction of
Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze.</p>

<p>An atmosphere of enthusiasm and good-will permeates the social life. No
community of the kind could have a more delightful spirit of unity than
that which pervades the Jaques-Dalcroze School. All students are keen
and anxious to live as full a life as possible, every one will willingly
and unselfishly take time and trouble to help others who know less than
themselves. The College has a unity born of kindred interests, and every
one glows with admiration and esteem for the genius at the head, and for
his wonderful method, whilst he himself simply radiates good-will and
enthusiasm, and works harder than any one else in the place. He makes a
point of knowing each one of his pupils personally, and remarkably quick
he is in summing up the various temperaments and characters of those
with whom he comes into contact.</p>

<p>The moral and mental tone of the College is pure and beautiful,
indeed it could not well be otherwise, for the work in itself is an
inspiration. A change is often observable in pupils after they have been
but a few weeks in residence, a change which tells of more alertness
of <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 59]</span>mind, of more animated purpose,
and even of higher ideals and aims in life.</p>

<div><img id="img15" class="center" src="images/img15.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">Dresden from Hellerau.</p>

<p>There are opportunities for the practice of many languages, for it is a
cosmopolitan centre. Nearly all European nationalities are represented,
but as yet the number of English people is not large. This, however,
will not long remain so, for the Jaques-Dalcroze method needs only to be
known in order to be as widely appreciated in Great Britain and the
United States as it is on the Continent.</p>

<p>The lessons are given in German, though occasionally French is used to
make clear anything that is not quite understood in the former tongue.
English people who do not know either of these languages need not look
upon this as an obstacle, for one quickly arrives at understanding
sufficiently well to gain the benefit from the lessons, and there is
always some one in the classes who will interpret when necessary.</p>

<p>The College itself is a fine example of the value of simplicity and
space in architecture. Both without and within, the block of buildings
is impressive, this effect being gained by an extreme simplicity of
decoration. The most modern methods of heating and ventilating are
provided, and there are large sun and air baths.</p>

<p>Completed in the spring of this year, and with accommodation for five
hundred students, the settlement stands on high ground about four miles
from Dresden, in an open, bracing, healthy spot, with charming walks in
all directions. The views are extensive; to the south lie the
Erzgebirge, to the south-east Saxon Switzerland, and, in a dip of the
nearer hills, Dresden.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VALUE_OF_EURHYTHMICS_TO_ART"
id="THE_VALUE_OF_EURHYTHMICS_TO_ART"></a>THE VALUE OF EURHYTHMICS TO
ART</h2>

<p>One of the most marked tendencies of modern aesthetic theory is to break
down the barriers that convention has erected between the various arts.
The truth is coming to be realized that the essential factor of poetry,
painting, sculpture, architecture and music is really of the same
quality, and that one art does not differ from another in anything but
the method of its expression and the conditions connected with that
method.</p>

<p>This common basis to the arts is more easily admitted than defined, but
one important element in it&mdash;perhaps the only element that can be given
a name&mdash;is rhythm. Rhythm of bodily movement, the dance, is the earliest
form of artistic expression known. It is accompanied in nearly every
case with rude music, the object being to emphasize the beat and
rhythmic movement with sound. The quickness with which children respond
to simple repetition of beat, translating the rhythm of the music into
movement, is merely recurrence of historical development.</p>

<p>Words with the music soon follow, and from these beginnings&mdash;probably
war-songs or religious chants&mdash;come song-poems and ultimately poetry as
we know it to-day. The still more modern development of prose-writing,
in the stylistic sense, is merely a step further.</p>

<p>The development on the other side follows a
some<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 61]</span>what similar line. The rhythm
of the dancing figure is reproduced in rude sculpture and bas-relief,
and then in painting.</p>

<div><img id="img16" class="center" src="images/img16.jpg" alt="Illustration" /></div>
<p class="caption">A Plastic Exercise.</p>

<p>So we have, as it were, a scale of the arts, with music at its centre
and prose-writing and painting at its two extremes. From end to end of
the scale runs the unifying desire for rhythm.<a name="FNanchor_1_7"
id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<blockquote><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_7"
id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> For valuable
help in these ideas I am indebted to Mr. J. W. Harvey. I should like to
quote verbatim one or two remarks of his on the subject, taken from a
recent letter: "Human motion gives the convergence of time (inner sense)
and space (outer sense), the spirit and the body. Time, which we are in
our inner selves, is more dissociable from us than space, which only our
bodies have; the one (time) can be interpreted emotionally and directly
by a time-sense; the other (space) symbolically, by a space-sense, which
is sight."</p></blockquote>

<p>To speak of the rhythm of painting may seem fanciful, but I think that
is only lack of familiarity. The expression is used here with no
intention of metaphor. Great pictures have a very marked and real
rhythm, of colour, of line, of feeling. The best prose-writing has
equally a distinct rhythm.</p>

<p>There was never an age in the history of art when rhythm played a more
important part than it does to-day. The teaching of M. Dalcroze at
Hellerau is a brilliant expression of the modern desire for rhythm in
its most fundamental form&mdash;that of bodily movement. Its nature and
origin have been described elsewhere; it is for me to try and suggest
the possibilities of its influence on every other art, and on the whole
of life.</p>

<p>Let it be clearly understood from the first that the rhythmic
training at Hellerau has an importance far deeper and more extended than
is contained in its imme<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 62]</span>diate
artistic beauty, its excellence as a purely musical training, or its
value to physical development. This is not a denial of its importance in
these three respects. The beauty of the classes is amazing; the actor,
as well as the designer of stage-effects, will come to thank M. Dalcroze
for the greatest contribution to their art that any age can show. He has
recreated the human body as a decorative unit. He has shown how men,
women and children can group themselves and can be grouped in designs as
lovely as any painted design, with the added charm of movement. He has
taught individuals their own power of gracious motion and attitude.
Musically and physically the results are equally wonderful. But the
training is more than a mere musical education; it is also emphatically
more than gymnastics.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the stress laid on individuality may be seen most easily
the possibilities of the system. Personal effort is looked for in every
pupil. Just as the learner of music must have the "opportunity of
expressing his own musical impressions with the technical means which
are taught him,"<a name="FNanchor_1_8"
id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
so the pupil at Hellerau must come to improvise from the rhythmic sense
innate in him, rhythms of his own.<a name="FNanchor_2_9"
id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2_9"
id="Footnote_2_9"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_2_9"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A good example
of the fertility and variety of the individual effort obtained at
Hellerau was seen at the Auff&uuml;hrung given on December 11, 1911. Two
pupils undertook to realize a Prelude of Chopin, their choice falling by
chance on the same Prelude. But hardly a movement of the two
interpretations was the same. The first girl lay on the ground the whole
time, her head on her arm, expressing in gentle movements of head, hands
and feet, her idea of the music. At one point near the end, with the
rising passion of the music, she raised herself on to her knees; then
sank down again to her full length.</p>

<p>
The second performer stood upright until the very end. At the most
intense moment her arms were stretched above her head; at the close of
the music she was bowed to the ground, in an attitude expressive of the
utmost grief. In such widely different ways did the same piece of music
speak to the individualities of these two girls.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 63]</span>To take a joy in the beauty of
the body, to train his mind to move graciously and harmoniously both in
itself and in relation to those around him, finally, to make his whole
life rhythmic&mdash;such an ideal is not only possible but almost
inevitable to the pupil at Hellerau. The keenness which possesses the
whole College, the delight of every one in their work, their
comradeship, their lack of self-consciousness, their clean sense of the
beauty of natural form, promises a new and more harmonious race, almost
a realization of Rousseau's ideal, and with it an era of truly rhythmic
artistic production.</p>

<p>That the soil is ready for the new seed may be shown by a moment's
consideration of what I consider to be a parallel development in
painting. There is in Munich a group of artists who call themselves Der
Blaue Reiter. They are led by a Russian, Wassily Kandinsky, and a
German, Franz Marc, and it is of Kandinsky's art that I propose to
speak. Kandinsky is that rare combination, an artist who can express
himself in both words and paint. His book&mdash;<i>&Uuml;ber das
Geistige in der Kunst</i><a name="FNanchor_1_10"
id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;is an interesting and subtle piece of
aesthetic philosophy. His painting is a realization of the attempt to
paint music. He has isolated the emotion caused by line
and <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 64]</span>colour from the external
association of idea. All form in the ordinary representative sense is
eliminated. But form there is in the deeper sense, the shapes and
rhythms of the <i>innerer Notwendigkeit</i>, and with it, haunting,
harmonious colour. To revert to a former metaphor, painting has been
brought into the centre of the scale. As Kandinsky says in his book:
"Shades of colour, like shades of sound, are of a much subtler nature,
cause much subtler vibrations of the spirit than can ever be given by
words." It is to achieve this finer utterance, to establish a surer and
more expressive connexion between spirit and spirit, that Kandinsky is
striving. His pictures are visions, beautiful abstractions of colour and
line which he has lived himself, deep down in his inmost soul. He is
intensely individual, as are all true mystics; at the same time the
spirit of his work is universal.</p>

<p>In this, then, as in so much else, Kandinsky and Dalcroze are advancing
side by side. They are leading the way to the truest art, and ultimately
to the truest life of all, which is a synthesis of the collective arts
and emotions of all nations, which is, at the same time, based on
individuality, because it represents the inner being of each one of its
devotees.</p>
